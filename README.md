# frontend-project
This project was made for the final assignment in the Frontend Web Development module I took back in Year 1 in Singapore Polytechnic. We were tasked to built at least 5 webpages for a "company", with a mix of HTML (+ Bootstrap), CSS, and JavaScript. I decided to base my project around an Artificial Intelligence (AI) consultancy group, where they provide machine learning services for various purposes -- primarily for:

    1. Individuals who want to play around and learn more about machine learning
    
    2. Students or children who want to learn more about machine learning
 
    3. Companies/Organisations that need machine learning for various reasons

A brief description of the five pages (All html files are located under /html files):

The first page (index.html) gives an introduction to the company and the product we are selling

The second page (aboutUs.html) gives more context to the company, where it shows awards and reviews from "customers"

The third page (educate.html) focuses on the importance of AI in the future and hence why we should be educating the future generations on how to make full use of AI. There is also a seminar invitation for students with a timer coded in JavaScript (/javascript/countdownTimer)

The fourth page (caseStudies.html) lists some case studies for those who are interested to see if the company's product matches their interests

The fifth page (register.html) is a payment page for those who would like to purchase the machine learning product (split into the aforementioned 3 categories)
